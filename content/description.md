Hi I am Conrad Lukawski!
  If elected, I will: 
  - Implement Electoral Reform: Table legislation to amend the Elections at with the most democratic system of candidate selection, ZMPR: In Zero Member Proportional Representation, every vote is worth nothing, and election results elect no representatives to the House of Commons.

  - Work on Budgeting and Transparency: Parliamentarians will have zero budget, zero office space, zero staffers, zero responsibilities, zero transparency, and zero salaries

  - Bring Computer Science/Cryptography Expertise to Parliament: I will use my knowledge in cryptography to apply the concept of “zero-knowledge proofs” to parliamentary procedure, we will create secure “zero-knowledge” laws: in which we can pass laws that nobody understands and nobody can enforce. This will protect the integrity of the Canadian justice system.

  - Address Housing Crisis Introduce Zero-housing policy in the GTA, I will task the federal government with a policy to take away everyone's house, so everyone can live in one big wide open space
